# if not installed globally run nodemon with :
npx nodemon <js file>

    # In some networked environments (such as a container running nodemon reading across a mounted drive), you will need to use the legacyWatch: true which enables Chokidar's polling.
# Via the CLI, use either --legacy-watch or -L for short:

nodemon -L
